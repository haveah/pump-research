1. **Sample Dataset #1: Prospective Participants**

This is a sample dataset of mentors and mentees interested in participating in the program. All of the raw data (mentor and mentee survey responses) are in the “mentor survey data” and “mentee survey data” tabs. These are prospective participants; no matches have been made yet.  

  Based on this dataset, please generate the following statistics about our prospective participants:

  _Quantitative:_  
  1. Total number of undergraduates participating (both mentors and mentees) with breakdown by year; total numbers of graduate students, faculty, and other categories
  2. Percentage of mentees that belong to each gender identity and each underrepresented identity category
  3. Pie chart visualizing the areas of interest of mentees
  4. Anything else you think is interesting or relevant


 _Qualitative:_  
 1. Themes in the response “what is your primary reason for seeking a psychology mentor?”
 2. Anything else you think is interesting or relevant

Send me the above stats and link to your edited/revised dataset (if you made any changes) by the time of our meeting.  

During our meeting, we’ll discuss managing these data and your ideas for ways to visualize and work with the data.

2. **Sample Dataset #2: Current Participant Survey**

These are fresh data we have just collected from mentees about how the program went this year.


_Quantitative:_  
Categorize/flag people based on the following criteria:
1. People who are interested in continuing with the same mentor
2. People who need to be rematched with a new mentor
3. People who want to become a mentor next year
4. Means and a graph of responses to: “How has your mentoring relationship impacted your feelings of belonging in the UW Department of Psychology?”

_Qualitative:_   
Themes in responses to the following two questions:
1. “People can seek mentorship relationship for a variety of reasons”
2. “What have you learned from your mentor?”
3. Anything else you think is interesting

We can talk about how you organized the data and your thoughts on data analysis.
